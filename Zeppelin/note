Zeppelin Ransomware is the successor of VegaLocker and is written in Delphi. Zeppelin is a highly configurable malware and can be deployed as an EXE, DLL, or wrapped in a PowerShell loader. It encrypts user data with AES-256 (CBC mode) + RSA-2048 to protect the private key and then requires a ransom to get the files back. However, it spares if the user is from CIS Countries.
