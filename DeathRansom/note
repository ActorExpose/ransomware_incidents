DeathRansom encrypts user files with AES and demands a ransom of 0.1 BTC. It deletes volume shadow copies to ensure the data cannot be restored easily. After the DeathRansom performs file encryption, it will drop ransom note named "read_me.txt" in each encrypted file's directory. An extension of .wctc is added to each encrypted file.
