Fireeye and other users of SolarWinds Orion IT monitoring and management software had been compromised by SolarWinds Supply Chain Attack. 
Threat actor behind this attack is identified as UNC2452 or Dark Halo. This infection is caused by downloading a torjanized update from SolarWinds.
 More than 18000 of its customers had download these updates. Once the update is downloaded and installed the backdoor remain dormant for two 
weeks, after it started to execute task called jobs. SUNBURST uses multiple techniques to evade detection and obscure their activity. It masquerades its network traffic as the
 Orion Improvement Program (OIP) protocol and stores reconnaissance results within legitimate plugin configuration files allowing it to blend in with legitimate SolarWinds activity.
